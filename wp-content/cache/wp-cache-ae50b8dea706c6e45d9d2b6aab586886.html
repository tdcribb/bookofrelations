						and conditions of these Terms of Use conflict with any applicable statute or rule of law, the affected terms and conditions will be deemed 
						inoperative but the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.
						</br></br>

					<span class="overlay-subtitles">WAIVER</span></br>
						No failure by either party to take any action or assert any right under these Terms of Use will be deemed to be a waiver of that right in 
						the event of the continuation or repetition of the circumstances giving rise to that right.
						</br></br>

					<span class="overlay-subtitles">ENTIRE AGREEMENT</span></br>
						These Terms of Use and the state-specific notifications below constitute the entire agreement between you and LCDD and govern your use of 
						the website and Online Services. These Terms of Use supersede any and all prior agreements between you and LCDD regarding your use of the 
						website and Online Services.
						</br></br>

					You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and possess the legal right and ability, on behalf of yourself or a minor child 
					of whom you are a parent or legal guardian, to agree to these Terms of Use and to use this website in accordance with these Terms of Use.
					</br></br>

					<span class="overlay-subtitles">E-SIGN DISCLOSURE AND CONSENT</span></br>
						This Electronic Disclosure and Consent (“Disclosure”) applies to any privacy or other notices, disclosures, reports, documents, communications, 
						or other records provided by LCDD or a Provider regarding the Online Services (collectively, “Notices”). By assenting to these Terms of Use, 
						you agree that LCDD and Providers (i) may provide you with any Notices that they may choose to send or make available to you, to the extent 
						allowed by law, in electronic form and (ii) that you have been able to read this Disclosure and have access to the software and hardware 
						(described below) necessary to access the Notices.
					</br></br>
						All Notices that LCDD or a Provider elect to provide to you in electronic form will be provided either (i) via e-mail to the address that you 
						provided upon enrollment or (ii) by posting the Notice on the website by which you access the Online Services. The delivery of any Notice is 
						effective when sent, regardless of how it is delivered to you, whether you read the Notice when you receive it, or whether you actually receive 
						the delivery.
					</br></br>
						Consent is a condition to the use of Online Services. If at any time you decide to withdraw your consent, you may do so by canceling or 
						discontinuing your use of the Online Services. Should you subsequently resume use of the Online Services, you will be deemed to have ratified 
						your original consent.
					</br></br>
						LCDD may treat the provision of an invalid e-mail address, or the subsequent malfunction of a previously valid e-mail address, as a withdrawal 
						of your consent to receive Notices in electronic form. LCDD will not impose any fee to process the withdrawal of your consent to receive Notices 
						in electronic form; however, your access to and use of the website and Online Services may be terminated. Any withdrawal of your consent to receive 
						Notices in electronic form will be effective only after we have a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal.
					</br></br>
						In order to access, view, and retain electronic Notices that LCDD makes available to you, you must: (i) have access to an Internet service account, 
						(ii) an e-mail account (and any necessary e-mail software), and (iii) have access to a personal computer, operating system, and telecommunications 
						connections to the Internet capable of receiving, accessing, displaying, and either printing or storing Notices received from LCDD in electronic 
						form via a plain text-formatted e-mail or by access to the website using your Internet browser application (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari).
					</br></br>
						LCDD will not send you a paper copy of a Notice which is available electronically unless you request it, or we otherwise deem it appropriate to do so. 
						You can obtain a paper copy of an electronic Notice by printing it yourself or by requesting that we mail you a paper copy, provided that such request 
						is made within a reasonable time after we first provided the electronic Notice to you. To request a paper copy, call us at 1-800-328-8602. LCDD may 
						charge you a reasonable service charge, of which we will have provided you prior notice, for the delivery of paper copies of any Notice provided to 
						you electronically pursuant to this authorization. LCDD reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to provide a paper (instead of electronic) 
						copy of any Notice that you have authorized us to provide electronically.
					</br></br>
						All Notices in either electronic or paper format from us to you will be considered “in writing.” You should print or download for your records a copy 
						of this Disclosure and any other Notice that is important to you.
					</br></br>
						You acknowledge and agree that your consent to electronic Notices is being provided in connection with a transaction affecting interstate commerce 
						that is subject to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, and that you and LCDD both intend that the Act apply to the 
						fullest extent possible to validate our ability to conduct business with you by electronic means.
					</br></br>
						LCDD reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of your electronic Notices, or to terminate or change the terms and 
						conditions on which it provides electronic Notices. LCDD will provide you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law.

					Don't let your family history be forgotten...</br>
					You fit into a bigger context than you probably think. Our past has created our present. How we are
					interconnected with our ancestors, al the way down to our parents, is a fascinating area of study. 
					But have you ever wondered how all of our ancestors may have been rlated to each other?</br></br>
					We aren't just talking about blood relations, or relations by marriage, but relationships founded 
					on geography, neighborhoods, businesses, travels and travails shared by people of a community.</br></br>
					As a member, you are able to access all of the data in our archives that directly and indirectly relate
					to you. With a better understanding of our past, we can have a grasp on who we may become in the future.</br>
					This is your opportunity to keep the past alive for generations to come.
